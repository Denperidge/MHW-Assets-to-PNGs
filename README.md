# MHW Assets to PNG

I wanted to get some PNG's out of the Monster Hunter World game files. That wasn't as easy as I'd had hoped.

## Setup

1. Download [MHWNoChunk](https://github.com/zhangtaoxinzi/MHWNoChunk) --> this will be used to extract the game files to .tex
2. Download [A Better MHW Texture Converter by Jodo](https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterworld/mods/864) --> this will convert the .tex to .dds
3. Install [Nvidia Texture Tools Exporter](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-texture-tools-exporter) --> this will convert the .dds to .png
